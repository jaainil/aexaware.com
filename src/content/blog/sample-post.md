# The Future of Web Development

Web development is evolving at a rapid pace. As we move into 2025, several key trends are emerging that will shape the way we build and interact with the web.

## AI-Driven Workflows

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword; it's a core part of the developer toolkit. From code generation to automated testing, AI is streamlining workflows and enabling developers to build faster and more efficiently.

## The Rise of WebAssembly

WebAssembly (Wasm) is unlocking new possibilities for the web. By allowing high-performance code to run in the browser, Wasm is enabling complex applications like video editing and 3D rendering to run natively on the web.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)

Frameworks like Astro and Next.js are making it easier than ever to build performant websites using SSR and SSG. By pre-rendering content, these frameworks ensure fast load times and better SEO.

## Conclusion

The future of web development is bright. By staying ahead of these trends, developers can build better, faster, and more engaging web experiences.
